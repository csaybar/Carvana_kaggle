        "As with any big purchase, full information and transparency are key. While most everyone describes buying a used car as frustrating, it’s just as annoying to sell one, especially online. Shoppers want to know everything about the car but they must rely on often blurry pictures and little information, keeping used car sales a largely inefficient, local industry.\n",

        "Carvana, a successful online used car startup, has seen opportunity to build long term trust with consumers and streamline the online buying process.\n",
        "\n",
        "An interesting part of their innovation is a custom rotating photo studio that automatically captures and processes 16 standard images of each vehicle in their inventory. While Carvana takes high quality photos, bright reflections and cars with similar colors as the background cause automation errors, which requires a skilled photo editor to change.\n",

        "In this competition, you’re challenged to develop an algorithm that automatically removes the photo studio background.

You’ll be analyzing a dataset of photos, covering different vehicles with a wide variety of year, make, and model combinations.\n",
